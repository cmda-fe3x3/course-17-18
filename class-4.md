In this assignment you’ll learn to add interactivity to a chart.

### Description

The project you’ll hand in will be similar to the one from
[Class 3: Transition][c3transition] but this time will render a non-basic chart
with non-trivial interaction.

1.  Pick a static non-basic chart from [d3’s example gallery][d3-examples]
    or use one of your previously made charts from assignments or assessment 1
2.  Copy-paste the files over to your own computer and get the chart working
    on d3@4
3.  Add a `<title>` element, or replace the one already there, with your GitHub
    username: `@username` (in my case `@wooorm`)
4.  Move CSS and JS from the HTML into their own files: `index.css` and
    `index.js`
5.  Add citations to the original work in `index.html` and `index.js`
6.  Add non-trivial interactivity to your chart.  Non-trivial means
    that the visualised data changes and uses enter, update, and exit.
    For example, this includes sorting and filtering and excludes zooming and
    tooltips
7.  Add a `readme.md` file similar to the one from
    [Class 2: Do you readme?!][c2readme] that additionally describes what you
    changed and how you applied interactivity

Hand in your code in a directory `username` (in my case `wooorm`) to
`site/class-4-interaction/` by creating a pull request from a branch
`interaction`.  Include `index.html`, `index.js`, `index.css`, `readme.md`,
optionally a `preview.png` file, and a data file (such as `index.json`,
`index.csv`, `index.tsv`).
