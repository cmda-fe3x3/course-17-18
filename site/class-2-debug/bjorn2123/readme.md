# Explanation Debug

For this assignment I copied the files again. First of all i check my console for errors. I fixed the two error that my console.log showed. After that I started with my index.js file and slowly read every line. With a little help of Maikel and Bas i managed to debug all my files and get a nice graph in my browser.
