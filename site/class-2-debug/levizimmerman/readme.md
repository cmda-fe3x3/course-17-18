# Debugger exercise
For this assignment youâ€™re going to fix a broken scatter plot. First, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all contain several bugs. Last, the chart uses d3@3 instead of d3@4.

* First, copy the files index.csv, index.css, index.html, and index.js from site/class-2/debug to your computer and start a simple server. If everything went OK, you should see two errors in your Console about resources that failed to load
* Fix the errors you just found. Then, fix the errors in the JavaScript and CSS. Depending on your knowledge of JavaScript, errors, and d3, this may be very hard. Feel free to ask others for help and try to fix the code together
* After all bugs are squashed, upgrade the chart from d3@3 to d3@4 (tip: see the changelog and release notes).
Hand in your bug-free and upgraded code in a directory username (in my case wooorm) to site/class-2-debug/ by creating a pull request.
