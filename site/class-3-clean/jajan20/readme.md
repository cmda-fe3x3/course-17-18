## Assignment:
Data cleaning assignment, used a lot of comments in my code to describe what the code does.

## Summary:
First I made sure the data was loaded. Then by using indexOf I identified which part of the data I needed and trimmed the rest of. Replaced the spaces and used commas to separate the values.
Set a parseTime variable to interpret the date/time column and return the data with a correct format. Return all the data in objects and group all the values with the same name together.
