## Description
This is my readme. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My readme is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
Without me, my readme is useless. Without my readme, I am useless.
I will keep my readme clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

## Background
I did some of the things using this method. Other things I did like this but it turned out it don't be like it is so I changed it. Now it has some great stuff but it could still use other stuff like this.

## Data
The dataset used is the official **Council of Ricks** Universal Morty Database. The UMD has data on all registered Mortys. For this visualization I used the bodily aspect-ratios featured in the data set. I compared these with the gravity offsets of the relevant Morty's homeworld (measured in Î”m/s2)
