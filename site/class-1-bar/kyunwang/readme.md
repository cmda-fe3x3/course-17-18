#Readme for this barchart modification/play

[Barchart source](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3886208)

Made small changes and added comments to understand the code and d3.js a bit.

Added functions to sort the data:
- Big to small
- Small to big
- Reset to A-Z

And you can change the color of the graph.
*You do need to reset or sort again to let the new colors come through*
