# Bar Chart Assignment
## Making a Bar Chart for the usage of my apps. 

For this assignment I made a Bar Chart including information of the usage of my Iphone apps. I used the codes for this assignment from the [Basis Bar Chart Section](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304). 

First I copied the codes and paste it in my code editor. Step by step I adjusted the codes and put in my own measured information. After that I made a CSS file to style my Bar Chart. The data I used is listed below.

### The data I Used
1. letter	frequency
