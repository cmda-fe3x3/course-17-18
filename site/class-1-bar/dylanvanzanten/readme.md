# Bar-chart

A simple bar-chart visualising the frequency per day based on the original [**@mbostock**][block-author].

## Background

For this assignment I had to learn the basics how to use D3.

## Data

The data that the chart is showing has two types:

* 'Frequency', uses the percentage of how much something is.
* 'Letters', shows the percentage with a letter. I've changed it into the days of a week.

## Features

* [`d3`] (https://d3js.org/)
* [`d3-scale`] (https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)
* [`d3-svg-axis`] (https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#api-reference)
