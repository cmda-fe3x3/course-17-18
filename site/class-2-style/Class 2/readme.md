# Find your own style

In this assignment we were to make sure, that the code that was already written for us would look more pleasant to the human-eye after we were done with it.

## Course

In Front-End Development 3 we learn to expand our thoughts on what is possible with writing code.  

Even though I' not an expert in writing code, I hope this course will eventually start making more sense to me. Until that moment... I'm trying to look up the code on the internet and make sense of it from there. 

With plug-ins like Beautify, I made sure my code looked better than the [original code].
