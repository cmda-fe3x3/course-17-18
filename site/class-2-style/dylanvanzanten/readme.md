# Style

A simple responsive donut chart visualising the populations of various age groups with colors. Original: [`bl.ock`][block]

## Background

For this assignment you had to change the structure of the HTML, CSS and JS files to a proper layout. All the files are minified (so on one rule). The HTML file was missing some "" and also missing some closing <> tags. The CSS I indented some of them, because I have a more proper layout of seeing the code better.
At the JS file I seperated the variabeles that don't have any connectioj with eachother.
