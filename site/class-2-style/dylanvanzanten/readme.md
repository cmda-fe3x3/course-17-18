# Style assignment for donut chart

In this readme you can find a donut chart that has refactored and reformatted.It is a simple and responsive donut chart based on the [Donut example from D3](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193 "D3 example").

## Explanation

First I started to fix the missing tags from the index.html file. The file was missing a closing body tag and also the linking JS files didn't have any quotation marks. After I fixed the HTML file I went to the CSS file. The file was really messy because it has been minimised. You can see the fixed files below in this screenshot:



The JS file I've changed some variables into some easier and quicker names. For example i've changed a into donut (name for the chart).
