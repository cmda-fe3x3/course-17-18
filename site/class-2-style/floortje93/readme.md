#readme.md for donut
This is a readme for the style choices i've made.

##Background
I looked at the simple responsive donut chart visualising the populations of various age
groups with pretty colours based on a [`bl.ock`][block]
by [**@mbostock**][block-author] (GPL-3.0). so I could see the proper structure of the code.
Thats how I knew where to enter and where to place a white space inbetween lines.
I added comments in the code for myself to understand the code.
